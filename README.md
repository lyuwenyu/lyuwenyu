<!-- ### Hi there 👋 🍀 🌱 -->

👋 Hi there

> I am an AI Researcher at Baidu Inc. which I joined in 2021. My research interest covers a wide range of topics in <ins>computer vision</ins> and <ins>multimodal large language model</ins>. My publications have over `1,600` citations (as of Dec. 2024).
> 
> My works on visual object detection include `RTDETR, RTDETRv2, PP-YOLOE, PP-YOLOE+, PP-YOLOE-SOD, PP-PicoDet and PP-YOLOv2`. The best known model *RTDETR* has been integrated into `huggingface/transformers` and `ultralytics/ultralytics` repositories. I also have some works on multimodal large language model including `PP-InsCapTagger, PP-InfinityDocData and PP-DocBee` for data analysis, data generation, and document image understanding. I am also a contributor of several prestigious communities, including `pytorch and PaddlePaddle`.
> 
> Before joining Baidu Inc., I was a Software Engineer at Microsoft from 2019 to 2021, and a Research Intern at Microsoft Research Asia (MSRA) from 2016 to 2017. I received my M.S. degree from Harbin Institute of Technology in 2018.
