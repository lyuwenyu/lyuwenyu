<!-- ### Hi there 👋 🍀 🌱 -->

👋 Hi there

> I am a Senior R&D Engineer at Baidu Inc. which I joined in 2021. My work covers a wide range of topics in <ins>computer vision</ins> and <ins>multimodal large language model</ins>.
> 
> My works on visual object detection include `RTDETR, RTDETRv2, PP-YOLOE, PP-YOLOE+, PP-YOLOE-SOD, PP-PicoDet and PP-YOLOv2`. The best known model, *RTDETR*, has been integrated by `huggingface/transformers` and `ultralytics/ultralytics` communities. I also have some works on multimodal large language model including `PP-InsCapTagger, PP-InfinityDocData and PP-DocBee(2B)` for data analysis, data generation, and document understanding. I am a contributor of several prestigious communities, including `PaddlePaddle and pytorch`. My publications have over `1,400` citations (as of Dec. 2024). 
> 
> Before joining Baidu Inc. , I was a Software Engineer at Microsoft from 2019 to 2021, and a Senior Engineer at Baidu Inc. from 2018 to 2019, and a research intern at Microsoft Research Asia (MSRA) from 2016 to 2017. I received my M.S. degree from Harbin Institute of Technology in 2018.
